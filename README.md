# Churn causality  
This repo contains scripts and material which aim to uncover the causal relation between churn and variuos factors such as competition, network congestion etc.

# To do  
* Working with non-linear models:
    * Check if just using the conditioning infered from the structure is good
    * Learning Directed Graphical Models from Nonlinear and Non-Gaussian Data: https://drive.google.com/open?id=11f0WbAZ5JIqFCrRPp0IZI95lb7J-rH4K  
* Latent variabels (instrumental variables)  
* Grouping variables (e.g. competition)  
* Model fit and validation (can't do cross validation)  
* Deal with bidirectional dependencies (These will arise a lot!)
